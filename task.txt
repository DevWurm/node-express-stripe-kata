Welcome to Task 2
=================

In this task you have to deal with the basics of Express.

We now want to set up our version endpoint to receive the information from the API Server.
To do so, implement the request handler in backend/src/v1/handlers/version.ts and include it into the route tree in backend/src/v1/apiRoutes.ts.

For any reason some moron unmounted the whole route tree from the application and removed the error handler. Please fix this in backend/src/app.ts.
